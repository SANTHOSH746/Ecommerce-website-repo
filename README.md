Project Title: SpectraLens - Your Personalized Spectacle Shop

Project Overview: SpectraLens is an e-commerce platform designed to make buying spectacles easier, more personal, and fun. It's not just about browsing through frames – it's about helping people find the perfect pair that suits their face, style, and vision needs. Whether you're looking for prescription glasses or just a trendy frame to rock, SpectraLens gives you a seamless experience with features like virtual try-ons, customized recommendations, and easy order tracking. It's a one-stop shop where buying glasses feels like a personal experience.

Key Features:

User Accounts: Sign up and log in securely, with options to use Google or Facebook. Explore Glasses: Browse a huge selection of spectacles based on categories like style, color, and function. Prescription Details: Users can either upload their prescription or enter details manually to find the right lenses. Virtual Try-On: Ever wanted to try on glasses before buying? Now you can, with augmented reality that lets you see how glasses look on your face through your phone’s camera. Smart Recommendations: The app suggests styles based on your preferences and what others with similar tastes are buying. Filter and Search: Easily narrow down choices based on frame type, color, material, and even your budget. Secure Payment: Pay with ease using trusted payment options like credit cards or digital wallets. Order Tracking: Keep track of where your glasses are in the shipping process, from order to delivery. Support: Chat with us instantly if you need help, or browse our FAQs for quick answers. Tech Stack:

Frontend: React.js for building the app interface, Redux to manage the app’s state, and Tailwind CSS for clean, responsive styling. Backend: Node.js and Express.js to handle server-side logic, MongoDB for storing user and product data, and JWT for secure authentication. Virtual Try-On: We’ll use AR technology (maybe WebRTC or Three.js) to make the try-on experience as realistic as possible. Payment: Stripe for secure transactions. Hosting: Netlify for the frontend and Heroku or AWS for the backend. Version Control: Git and GitHub for managing the project. Why This Project: I chose this idea because buying glasses is something we all do, but it’s often not the most exciting experience. I wanted to make it easier, more fun, and personalized. Adding features like virtual try-on and recommendations makes it feel like you're getting personal attention, even though it’s all online. This project excites me because I’ll be able to work with cool technologies like AR, improve my full-stack development skills, and create something that can genuinely help people. It’s a blend of practical and innovative, and I think it’s a perfect challenge for me.
